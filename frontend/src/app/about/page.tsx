            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Over an intense weekend we prototyped a fully on-chain, automated investing experience: seamsless onboarding with Coinbase Smart Wallet, live market data via Chainlink oracles, Uniswap V3 execution on Base, and automated upkeep to keep strategies running 24/7.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              We presented our prototype in front of judges and sponsors, and the response was clear: <br/>
              Thereâ€™s a real need for simple, secure, self-sovereign solutions for long-term investing in Bitcoin and digital assets. 
              That momentum carried forward, what started as a scrappy prototype is evolving into the product you see today.
