              Over an intense weekend we prototyped a fully on-chain, automated Bitcoin investing experience: seamsless onboarding with Coinbase Smart Wallet, 
              live market data via Chainlink oracles, Uniswap V3 execution on Base, and Chainlink Automation to keep the DCA strategies running 24/7.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              We presented our prototype in front of judges and sponsors, and the response reinforced our belief: <br/>
              There’s a real need for simple, secure, self-sovereign solutions for long-term investing in Bitcoin and digital assets. 
              What started as a scrappy prototype is now evolving into a fully featured de-fi protocol.
